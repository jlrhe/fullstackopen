assignments for the course in fullstackopen.com
I'm doing the course in finnish, so some of the assignments (most notably the flow charts of part 0[osa0]) will be in finnish.
In the code and comments I'll try to stick to using english, but a tired mind may sometimes default to finnish without me noticing.

Since the course material omits semicolons I will try to do it also to keep consistency, but I might put a few in by habit (just browsed the flamewars that the conversations about this topic are - omitting them won simply because writing them on a finnish-layout keyboard is a hassle I never liked).
